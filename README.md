This repository serves as a comprehensive, interactive guide documenting the end-to-end process of setting up a development environment for a React application and deploying it to GitHub Pages.

The documentation itself is built as a **React application**, with all the content and interactive elements residing within the `src/App.jsx` file. This means you are looking at the *result* of the process, while simultaneously learning *how* to achieve it.

  * Viewing the application in your browser.  
* **Connecting to GitHub & Initial Commit:**  
  * Initializing a local Git repository.  
  * Staging and committing your code.  
  * Creating a new repository on GitHub.com.  
  * Linking your local repository to GitHub and pushing your code.  
* **Deploying to GitHub Pages:**  
  * Installing the `gh-pages` npm package.  
  * Configuring `package.json` with the `homepage` and deployment scripts.  
  * **Crucially, configuring `vite.config.js` with the `base` path for correct asset loading on GitHub Pages.**  
  * Running the deployment command.  
  * Verifying the live site on GitHub Pages.  
* **Troubleshooting Tips:**  
  * Common issues like blank pages, `npm` errors, and deployment delays.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used**

* **React:** For building the interactive user interface.
